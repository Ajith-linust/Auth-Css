# React + TS + Vite + Reduxjs/toolkit

This repository is dedicated exclusively to design-related work and does not support Auth0 integration. In React, Auth0 (@auth0/@auth0-react) does not support embedded authentication and requires a domain. Therefore, this repository has been created primarily for CSS purposes.
